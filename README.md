## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

Second project using Tailwind CSS.
I learned how to add custom local fonts, use the hover state, using 
responsive utility variants even though it was mentioned not to use media queries, and box shadow.

### Continued development

I am currently learning Tailwind CSS, and I plan to continue refining my skills with it for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet](https://www.creative-tim.com/twcomponents/cheatsheet) - This helped me to quickly find Tailwind CSS classes needed for this challenge. I really liked the simplicity of the cheat sheet and will continue using it until I get a good grasp of Tailwind CSS classes.
- [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I followed Tailwind CSS documentation to configure a custom box shadow and to add local fonts.
- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - I followed this mdn web article to learn how box shadows work and apply the learning on the challenge at hand.
